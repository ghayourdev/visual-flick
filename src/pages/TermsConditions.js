                    <h3 className="theme-h3">Refund Policy / Money Back Guarantee</h3>
                    <p className="theme-p">In any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after delivery if the initial design concepts are approved, or a change is requested unless Vertualizedâ„¢ cancels or terminates your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-performance.</p>
                    <h3 className="theme-h3">All refund requests will be fulfilled as per the following arrangement:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You make a request when the initial concepts for a logo are offered. However once you approve or request changes in the initial designs, the refund offer becomes void and refund request will not be entertained.</li>
                        <li>If request for refund is made before the delivery of initial design concepts, then you would be eligible for Full Refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</li>
                        <li>If request for refund is made within 48 hours, you would be eligible for 66% refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</li>
                        <li>If request for refund is made between 48- 120 hours of the initial design delivery, you would be eligible 33% refund (less 10% service & processing fee).</li>
                        <li>No refund request will be entertained after 120 hours of your initial design delivery, however since we believe in 100% customer satisfaction you`re encouraged to contact us in case of any concern.</li>
                        <li>No refund request will be entertained if you have not taken any action on your order for 30 days after placing your order. However, if you want to reactivate your design order, you will be charged a certain fee depending on your project.</li>
                        <li>No refund requests will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.</li>
                        <li>For website packages no refund will be entertained once website development has been completed or once the website has been deployed live.</li>
                        <li>For video animation packages no refund request will be entertained after the designing of the storyboard.</li>
                        <li>All refund requests should be communicated to the support department. Vertualized, based on the violation of your user agreement reserves the right to approve/disapprove your request on an individual case to case basis.</li>
                        <li>For Vertualized / Custom packages, refund will be applicable the same as it is on the single packages.</li>
                        <li>For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim refund for the website service at the time of initial design only.</li>
                        <li>A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given however further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction</li>
                        <li>Money back guarantee is based on that the order is placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim refund, we do not consider it a good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request.</li>
                        <li>All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results.</li>
                        <li>100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a re-draw if our designed logo is to be found considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence and Vertualized will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to get their art work copyrighted.</li>
